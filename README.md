## üß© Abstract

>Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries have become the primary power source in different domains due to their higher energy and power density. With their dominant application in mobile phones, notebooks, and, in particular, electric cars, their market in 2022 was estimated to be up to 48 billion U.S. dollars. However, the mass employment of this cell architecture is also leading to counterfeiting issues, with many third parties exaggerating their capacity, disguising compromised cells as legitimate, and ignoring safety measures to push down their price. This problem becomes particularly relevant in electric vehicles (EVs), where the proper functioning of each cell is crucial for the safety of the driver and the passengers. In this paper, we propose **DCAuth** and **EISthentication**, two novel methods for the automatic authentication of lithium-ion batteries using data retrievable from their regular usage. Without relying on any external device, our techniques are resilient to the most common and critical counterfeit practices and are scalable to several batteries and devices. Our methods can correctly identify both lithium cell architectures and cell samples using, respectively, Differential Capacity Analysis (DCA) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). To test our proposed methodology, we collect a large number of publicly available datasets and process them to extract meaningful features from their time-series data. Both our methodologies obtain high accuracy values in the authentication of battery chemistries and battery models. With this work, manufacturers can ensure that each device is boarding a battery from a pre-defined set of authorized models, thus guaranteeing their operative state and safety measures.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

First, start by cloning the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mhackiori/EISthentication.git
cd EISthentication
```
<sup>NOTE: if you're accessing this data from the anonymized repository, the above command might not work. Instead, you can download the repository from [here]().</sup>

Then, install the required Python packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You now need to add the datasets in the repository. You can do this by downloading the zip file [here]() and extracting it in this repository.

To replicate the results in our paper, you simply need to execute the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/Mhackiori/EISthentication/blob/main/EISthentication.ipynb).
